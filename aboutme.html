  <p> I was born on February 27, 2000 in San Francisco. Both of my parents immigrated
   to The United States before I was born. My mother is from Ireland and my father is from Indonesia.
   That is where my name comes from. Saoirse means "freedom" in Irish and Anggreni is my father's sister's name,
   she passed away when he was young. </p>
